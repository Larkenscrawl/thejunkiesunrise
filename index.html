<p>The paper in her hands said <span class="colored-text" onclick="toggleText(this)" style="color: red;">AIDS</span> and her feet struck ground that wobbled like one of them rope bridges from movies. Full-blown <span class="colored-text" onclick="toggleText(this)" style="color: red;">AIDS</span>. Dirty spike sick trick who knows. She shuffled out of the bleachy backwash of hospital light and into the cozy asshole of the late PMs. She put the paper away with the hospital bill and the Narcan a concerned nurse gave her. Did she feel different? Other than the knot of dope sickness that’s always stowed away in her gut anyway? Maybe the skin was a little tender maybe the eye had a little tingle in it. Anybody’s guess which scab on the face reflected on that dildo shop window was from the dope and which was from the bug. Her greasy goodwill sweater hung down near to her forearm like a dying slug trying to bring her down with it. Settle down she thought won’t be a minute.</p>

<p>Sat at the bus stop she adjusted her pink miniskirt and fetched the doodad from her purse. Looked like a box thing with two buttons and a few dials on it. The trick gave it to her was some guy that worked at a lab downstate cooked to the gills on oxy. “What’s that?” She’d said when he handed the thing to her.</p>
<p>“Worth a blowjob and a hit is what it is.”</p>
<p>“Cash only.”</p>
<p>“No no you don’t fucking understand listen this shit’s the real deal look.”</p>
<p>He’d pressed a button and the motel room shimmied and she saw ghosts around them. It was her and the trick but faint and wavy like a TV station tuned to a bad signal. <span class="colored-text" onclick="toggleText(this)" style="color: red;">She saw her ghost self put a pill on its ghost tongue, walk to the ghost trick and stick it in his mouth. She saw the ghost trick swallow it and pass out. Her ghost self then rummaged through the ghost trick’s coat pocket, grabbed his wallet, and bailed.</span></p>
<p>The trick pressed the button again and the ghosts vanished.</p>
<p>“Damn girl that’s cold; wouldja really do that?” the trick had said.</p>
<p>“Fuck was that? Did you give me something?” she said.</p>
<p>“That was something that coulda happened. This is what I’m fucking trying to tell you. This shit shows you shit that could happen. These dials set the date and place you wanna see what coulda gone different. And you press this other button here it puts you there. Could be you could be a fucking lawyer or whatever. You get me now? This button only works once though. Can’t bring the device with you into an alternate reality.” He said “This is world-changing shit. Like fucking decades in the making. Now can I get my dick sucked?”</p>
<p>Fuck it she’d thought and took the doodad. She gave him some Ox and mediocre head. He asked her to kick him in the nads a couple times too and she threw that in for free.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>The bus dropped her off near T-Rash’s trailer park. She went to his double wide and asked him for a few days’ worth. “What you want that much for baby?” he said letting her in.</p>
<p>“Got the bug. Might off myself.”</p>
<p> “Say what?” He said.</p>
<p>For once there was no one else around. Seems every time she rocked up to T-Rash’s you’d have to hop over five junkies to get to the kitchen. She looked around and didn’t see any vomit or piss neither. There was trash all over but far as dealer’s places go that qualified as clean.</p>
<p>“I said I got the <span class="colored-text" onclick="toggleText(this)" style="color: red;">AIDS</span>. Full-blown and I don’t know if I wanna deal with that shit.”</p>
<p>“Fuck… well… guess they’s worse ways to go. Just go do it somewhere else I don’t want no heat.” He said and handed her the bundle.</p>
<p>“See ya around Terrence.” She said and left.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>The bandstand at the park seemed as good a place as any to kick it. She used to watch her sister playing the lap steel guitar from below and wonder if she’d ever make it up here. Well now she has for a one-night only show to an audience of zero. She sat on the floor against one of the railings and dug into her purse for her spike. She touched the doodad instead and pulled it out.</p>
<p>How the fuck did it even work? She’d seen the ghosts in that dingy motel room clear as the smog swishing in front of her right now. Shit that could have been. She turned the dials to fourteen years ago and googled the coordinates to her childhood home on her phone so she could enter those as well. The surroundings started to shimmy again and she saw ghosts this time dozens of them. It was Dad’s superbowl barbeque in the backyard. Her cousin Sarah hadn’t come (her sister Haley was out of town) so she just sat by herself next to the salad table while everyone gathered by the grill and the kegs. Owen Dad’s boss from the auto-repair shop who enjoyed giving her brother nut taps and yucking it up afterwards lumbered over. He pulled a bill from his camo padded vest and said “how’d you like to make a twenty?” Everybody was being so loud he didn’t bother saying it low.</p>
<p>“What for?” she said looking up. He was wide and tapered up like a dirt mound stacked to six foot three.</p>
<p>“Whaddayasay we go in the tool shed and I show ya what for?”</p>
<p>“Fuck off” she said.</p>
<p>“Don’t be like that now how about fifty?”</p>
<p>“Eat shit you bastard I’m fourteen.”</p>
<p>“Stuck-up bitch” he said and left trailing booze smell behind him.</p>
<p>“Make it a hundred” she said.</p>
<p>“Fifty” he said.</p>
<p>“A hundred or I’m calling the cops” she said.</p>
<p>“Fine…” He said “fuckin’ gold diggers startin’ early these days…”</p>
<p>“Fuck you even talking to me for? I’m gonna call my dad!”</p>
<p>“Call him he’s a bitch”</p>
<p>“Dad!”</p>
<p>“No wait fuck shush ok I’m going” he said and left.</p>
<p>She pressed the button again and the ghosts went away. (she pressed the off button)</p>
<p>She turned the dials to five years after that in Owen’s office in the auto-repair shop.  She sees her desiccated nineteen-going-on-forty-five body standing by the door fidgeting as Owen looked at the computer screen. She could barely find a place to stand among the snarl of electric cords.</
