    <h1>The Mainline Shift</h1>
    <p>“You know yer gonna need to turn a lot more if yer gonna go on buying a whole gram on the daily. Why don’t I switch you to the white stuff?” Ghost Owen said.</p>
    <p>“I ain’t fuck with no needles” Ghost Maggie said.</p>
    <p>He turned to her “like you ain’t taken your fair share of pricks hur hur. Come on I got my spike right here let’s do it together I’ll boot ya up.”</p>
    <p><span class="colored-text" data-block="block3" data-index="0" onclick="toggleText(this)" style="color: red;">“Just give me the black tar,” she said.<br>“Fine, suit yerself,” he said, swiveling back to his desk and opening the bottom drawer.</span></p>

    <p><span class="colored-text" data-block="block1" data-index="0" onclick="toggleText(this)" style="color: red;">She saw her ghost self put a pill on her ghost tongue, walk to the ghost trick and stick it in his mouth. She saw the ghost trick swallow it and pass out. Her ghost self then rummaged through the ghost trick’s coat pocket, grabbed his wallet, and bailed.</span></p>

    <p><span class="colored-text" data-block="block2" data-index="0" onclick="toggleText(this)" style="color: red;">“Fuck off,” she said.<br>“Don’t be like that, now, how about fifty?”<br>“Eat shit, you bastard, I’m fourteen.”<br>“Stuck-up bitch” he said and left, trailing booze stink behind him.</span></p>
    
    <p><span class="colored-text" data-block="block4" data-index="0" onclick="toggleText(this)" style="color: red;">“I can’t, Haley… I’ve tried…”<br>“Try again… You’re not a junkie, Maggie, you know that…”<br>“Just give me a few months… I’ll find somewhere else to stay, I just need a few months…”<br>“You’ve said that before”<br>“Just a few months, so I can get my shit in order.”<br>“No, Maggie… I’m either driving you to the rehab center right now or you’re on your own.”<br>Maggie looked her sister in the eye, “Haley, you’re being mean.”<br>Haley wiped her tears, looked away. “I’m sorry Maggie… You should pack up, now.”</span></p>

    <p><span class="colored-text" data-block="block5" data-index="0" onclick="toggleText(this)" style="color: #000000;">shooting up her arm, closing her eyes, and dying, thick spit trickling down her hung head.</span></p>

    <p>Maggie pushed the off button and put the doodad down. She grabbed her kit from her purse, cooked everything she had, and loaded the spike. Four grams or more in there could take out someone that was already dead. She squeezed the plunger and saw the stream draw a trail between her legs leading to the entrance to the bandstand. She strapped her arm up and licked the needle. A car drove by blaring Bill Withers’ “Lovely Day” and she didn’t find it funny.</p>

    <p>Then I look at you<br>
    And the world’s alright with me…</p>

    <p>She closed her eyes and sighed.<br>
    Can’t hurt to take one more look.<br>
    She put the spike between her teeth, grabbed the doodad and set the date and time to here now. She saw her ghost self <span class="colored-text" data-block="block5" data-index="0" onclick="toggleText(this)" style="color: #000000;">shooting up her arm, closing her eyes, and dying, thick spit trickling down her hung head.</span></p>
    <p><span class="colored-text" data-block="block5" data-index="1" onclick="toggleText(this)" style="color: #333333;">shooting up her neck, rolling her eyes until it was all white like a statue, and dying.</span></p>
    <p><span class="colored-text" data-block="block5" data-index="2" onclick="toggleText(this)" style="color: #666666;">taking off her heels and shooting up between her toes and slumping over, dead, arms outstretched like a sleeping child, a little blood from the head from slamming on the ground.</span></p>
    <p><span class="colored-text" data-block="block5" data-index="3" onclick="toggleText(this)" style="color: #999999;">shooting up the artery and flopping around in agony like a fish on a boat, screaming so hard her voice cracked and vanished, then dying with her hip thrust in the air like a yoga pose.</span></p>
    <p><span class="colored-text" data-block="block5" data-index="4" onclick="toggleText(this)" style="color: #CCCCCC;">dying in the middle of the bandstand.</span></p>
    <p><span class="colored-text" data-block="block5" data-index="5" onclick="toggleText(this)" style="color: #DDDDDD;">dying at the entrance of the bandstand.</span></p>
    <p><span class="colored-text" data-block="block5" data-index="6" onclick="toggleText(this)" style="color: #EEEEEE;">dying facing out.</span></p>
    <p><span class="colored-text" data-block="block5" data-index="7" onclick="toggleText(this)" style="color: #FFFFFF;">dying facing in.</span></p>
    
    <p>As the sun started to rise and wash away the fog, she noticed the ghosts started growing fainter. The lights on the doodad started to flutter. It was running out of juice. She kept flicking through but it was all the same thing: the same corpse lying in shit and piss jumping from place to place in the bandstand.</p>

    <p>Then she pressed the button and saw nothing. She looked around, no corpse. Was there something climbing the steps to the bandstand? She squinted. Sure enough, there it was: a fuzzy thing she had to go up to it to see it clearly. It was another ghost self but difficult to recognize. This one was wearing clean jeans and a tank top and her skin, though a little blistered and scabbed, looked a little plumper like it was actually covering a living thing. The ghost folded her arms on the railing of the bandstand and watched the magenta sunrise splash over the park. She then took a medicine bottle from her pocket. Maggie could barely read the label but eventually she saw it said “Retrovir.” The ghost swallowed a tablet from it. She looked tired but peaceful. Maggie’d seen many sunrises from long nights out but couldn’t remember looking at one that way before. Like it wasn’t a burden.</p>

    <p>Maggie looked at the device. The lights were barely flashing now. The ghost was blending into the air. If she pressed the other button she would take the ghost’s place in that reality. But then again she and this other Maggie were still standing here. Whatever was in that other one that allowed her to pick life over death was also inside herself.</p>

    <p>Maggie turned away from the ghost, spat out the syringe and stepped on it. She put the doodad on the railing and climbed out of the bandstand. The tint of magenta was now turning amber like a honey jar. The grass in the park was dewy like hair after a shower. She heard the first buses, cars and birds. The city was yawning.</p>

    <p>The bug might kill me she thought but it won’t beat me.</p>
